Modelling Prey Pursuit (Lion-Zebra)

This Matlab script is a simulation of a predator prey pursuit. The simulation was generated for a manuscript entitled:
How the Zebra got its Rump Stripes: Salience at Distance and in Motion, by A. Muhl-Richardson, M. G. Parker & G. Davis

The prey (zebra) runs along the x axis from point (0,0)
The predator (lion) starts at given distance in y, and at x=0
Starting distance and predator max speed are altered sequentially to model the difference in chase time, under these conditions, between 
the situation in which the predator aims at the front of the zebra or at the back of the zebra.

Many parameters can be adjusted including:
Predator max speed
Prey max speed
Predator acceleration
Prey acceleration
Predator speed increase increment
Predator starting distance
Predator distance increase increment
Max chase time
