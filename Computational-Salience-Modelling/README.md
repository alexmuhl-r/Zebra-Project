Salience modelling for this project primarily used the Learning Discriminative Subspaces (LDS) model within the MATLAB implementation of SMILER (Wloka et al., 2018; https://arxiv.org/abs/1812.08848). Additional salience maps were also generated using the Graph-based Visual Salience (GBVS) and Fast and Efficient (FES) models within the same package.
