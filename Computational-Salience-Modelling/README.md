Salience modelling for this project primarily used the Learning Discriminative Subspaces (LDS) model within the MATLAB implementation of SMILER (Wloka et al., 2018; https://arxiv.org/abs/1812.08848). Additional salience maps were also generated using the Graph-based Visual Salience (GBVS) and Fast and Efficient (FES) models within the same package. Unless otherwise stated default parameters were used.

The code to run these models included in SMILER.m is adapted from the example code included with the MATLAB implementation of SMILER available at https://github.com/TsotsosLab/SMILER
